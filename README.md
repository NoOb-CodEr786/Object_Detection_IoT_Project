# Object Detection IoT Project
---------------------------
Welcome to the README file for my small object detection IoT project! This project showcases a compact and efficient system designed to detect objects in real-time using IoT technologies.

# Project Overview
-----------------------------
The main objective of this project is to enhance safety and efficiency by accurately detecting small objects in diverse environments. By leveraging the power of IoT, we can prevent accidents and optimize operations in various settings. 


# Hardware Components
--------------------
To achieve the project's goals, the following hardware components were utilized:

Arduino Uno: Serves as the central control unit for the system.

Servo Motor: Enables precise rotation of the ultrasonic sensor.

Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures distances and detects objects within its range.

# Software and Visualization
----------------------------

To demonstrate the project's functionality, processing software was employed. This software provides an intuitive visual representation of real-time object detection using data from the ultrasonic sensor. The processing software showcases the detected objects effectively and allows for monitoring and analysis.
